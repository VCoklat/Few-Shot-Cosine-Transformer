# Summary of Changes: Dynamic Weighting Formula Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a dynamic weighting mechanism that combines three loss components to improve accuracy in few-shot learning tasks.

## Files Modified

### 1. `methods/transformer.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `variance_regularization()` method implementing Equation 5
- Added `covariance_regularization()` method implementing Equation 6
- Added weight predictor network for dynamic weight computation
- Modified `set_forward_loss()` to combine three loss components

## Mathematical Implementation

### Equation 4: Cross-Entropy Loss
```python
ce_loss = self.loss_fn(scores, target)
```
Standard PyTorch CrossEntropyLoss

### Equation 5: Variance Regularization
```python
def variance_regularization(self, E):
    var_per_dim = torch.var(E, dim=0)
    sigma = torch.sqrt(var_per_dim + self.epsilon)
    V = torch.mean(torch.clamp(self.gamma - sigma, min=0.0))
    return V
```
Implements: V(E) = (1/m) * Σ max(0, γ - σ(E_j, ε))

### Equation 6: Covariance Regularization
```python
def covariance_regularization(self, E):
    E_mean = torch.mean(E, dim=0, keepdim=True)
    E_centered = E - E_mean
    batch_size = E.size(0)
    cov = torch.matmul(E_centered.T, E_centered) / (batch_size - 1)
    m = E.size(1)
    off_diag_mask = ~torch.eye(m, dtype=torch.bool, device=E.device)
    C = torch.sum(cov[off_diag_mask] ** 2) / m
    return C
```
Implements: C(E) = sum of squared off-diagonal covariance coefficients

### Dynamic Weighting
```python
weights = self.weight_predictor(global_features)  # Outputs 3 weights
w_ce, w_var, w_cov = weights[0], weights[1], weights[2]
loss = w_ce * ce_loss + w_var * var_reg + w_cov * cov_reg
```

## Key Features

1. **Backward Compatible**: Setting `use_regularization=False` reverts to original behavior
2. **Automatic Weighting**: Neural network predicts optimal weights per batch
3. **Mathematically Correct**: All equations implemented exactly as specified
4. **Well Tested**: Unit tests verify correctness
5. **Well Documented**: Comprehensive docs and examples

## Usage

### Minimal Change to Enable
```python
# Before:
model = FewShotTransformer(backbone.ResNet10, n_way=5, k_shot=5, n_query=15)

# After (with dynamic weighting):
model = FewShotTransformer(
    backbone.ResNet10, n_way=5, k_shot=5, n_query=15,
    gamma=0.1, epsilon=1e-8, use_regularization=True
)
```

### To Disable (Baseline Comparison)
```python
model = FewShotTransformer(
    backbone.ResNet10, n_way=5, k_shot=5, n_query=15,
    use_regularization=False
)
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Dynamic combination of objectives
2. **Better Generalization**: Regularization prevents overfitting
3. **Stable Training**: Variance constraint helps numerical stability
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Weights adjust based on data characteristics

## Testing

All implementations have been tested for:
- ✓ Syntax correctness
- ✓ Mathematical correctness
- ✓ Unit test coverage
- ✓ Example code execution

## Next Steps for Users

1. Train with `use_regularization=True` on your dataset
2. Compare accuracy with baseline (`use_regularization=False`)
3. Optionally tune `gamma` parameter (default 0.1 from paper)
4. Monitor training to verify improved accuracy

## Code Quality

- Minimal changes to existing code
- Maintains existing API compatibility
- Clear documentation and comments
- Follows existing code style
- No breaking changes

## Verification

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_dynamic_weighting.py
```

Expected output: All tests passed ✓
