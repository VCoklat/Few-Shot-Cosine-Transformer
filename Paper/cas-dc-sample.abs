Diagnosing skin cancer in low-resource settings requires expert-level accuracy with minimal data, a challenge where standard deep learning often fails. This paper presents \textbf{Dynamic VIC}, an adaptive, lightweight expert system designed for clinical decision support under extreme data scarcity. Unlike static few-shot learning (FSL) models, Dynamic VIC introduces an \textbf{Episode-Adaptive Lambda Predictor} that dynamically adjusts regularization weights for Variance-Invariance-Covariance (VIC) terms based on real-time episode difficulty. This mechanism functions as a meta-expert, tightening constraints during ambiguous diagnostic scenarios while relaxing them for clear-cut cases. Validated on the HAM10000 dermatology dataset, our system achieves a \textbf{+20.52\%} accuracy gain over baselines using a lightweight SE-Conv4 backbone (0.25M parameters), demonstrating that dynamic covariance regularization is a critical enabler for deployable, high-precision medical AI.
