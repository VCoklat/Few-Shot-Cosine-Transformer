# Installation instructions:
# If you encounter "numpy.dtype size changed" error after installation, run:
#   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall numpy scikit-learn
#
# This requirements.txt uses version constraints to prevent binary incompatibility
# between numpy and scikit-learn that causes "numpy.dtype size changed" errors.

# Core numerical computing - install these first with compatible versions
# numpy 1.24.x is compatible with scikit-learn 1.3.x and works with Python 3.8-3.12
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# Machine learning library - must be compatible with numpy version above
# scikit-learn 1.3.x is compiled against numpy 1.24.x
scikit-learn>=1.3.0,<1.5.0

# Scientific computing - compatible with numpy 1.24.x
scipy>=1.10.0,<2.0.0
