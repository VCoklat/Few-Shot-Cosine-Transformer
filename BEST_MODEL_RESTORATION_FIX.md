# Fix: Best Model Restoration After Training

## Problem Statement
The problem statement requested to "check all of the commit restore to the best commit in val_acc", which refers to ensuring that the training function correctly restores the model to the checkpoint with the best validation accuracy.

## Issue Identified
The `train()` function in both `train.py` and `train_test.py` had an inconsistency:
- During training, it saves the best model (based on validation accuracy) to `best_model.tar`
- After training completes, it returns the model from the **last epoch**, not the best model
- This means the returned model may have worse validation accuracy than the saved best model

## Root Cause
At the end of the training loop, the function simply returned the model as-is:
```python
return model  # Returns model from last epoch
```

This model contains weights from the last training epoch, which may not be the epoch with the best validation accuracy.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `train()` function in both files to:

1. **Track the best epoch**: Added `best_epoch` variable to record which epoch had the best validation accuracy
2. **Load best model before returning**: After training completes, load the saved best model checkpoint
3. **Provide informative output**: Print which epoch had the best validation accuracy

### Code Changes

#### train.py (lines 47-87)
```python
max_acc = 0
best_epoch = -1  # NEW: Track best epoch

for epoch in range(num_epoch):
    # ... training loop ...
    if acc > max_acc:
        max_acc = acc
        best_epoch = epoch  # NEW: Record best epoch
        # ... save best model ...

# NEW: Load best model before returning
print(f"Training completed. Best validation accuracy: {max_acc:.2f}% at epoch {best_epoch}")
best_model_file = os.path.join(params.checkpoint_dir, 'best_model.tar')
if os.path.isfile(best_model_file):
    print(f"Loading best model from {best_model_file}")
    checkpoint = torch.load(best_model_file)
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state'])

return model  # Now returns best model
```

#### train_test.py (lines 370-507)
Same changes as train.py

## Verification
Created `test_best_model_restore.py` to verify the fix:
- ✓ Tests that `best_epoch` is tracked correctly
- ✓ Tests that best model is loaded before returning
- ✓ Tests the code flow is correct (save → load → return)
- ✓ All tests pass

## Impact
### Before the fix:
- Training completes with epoch 10
- Validation accuracy at epoch 10: 75%
- Best validation accuracy at epoch 6: 85%
- **Returned model**: Has 75% validation accuracy (epoch 10)
- **Saved best_model.tar**: Has 85% validation accuracy (epoch 6)

### After the fix:
- Training completes with epoch 10
- Validation accuracy at epoch 10: 75%
- Best validation accuracy at epoch 6: 85%
- **Returned model**: Has 85% validation accuracy (epoch 6) ✓
- **Saved best_model.tar**: Has 85% validation accuracy (epoch 6) ✓

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: The returned model always has the best validation accuracy
2. **Correctness**: Subsequent code using the model gets optimal weights
3. **Transparency**: Clear messages show which epoch was best
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work, but with better results

## Testing
Run the test to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_best_model_restore.py
```

All tests should pass with output:
```
ALL TESTS PASSED! ✓✓✓
```
