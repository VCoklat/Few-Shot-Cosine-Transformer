# Checkpoint Save Error Fix

## Problem

During training, the model would crash with a `RuntimeError` when trying to save checkpoints:

```
RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:815] . PytorchStreamWriter failed writing file data/230: file write failed
RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:626] . unexpected pos 79088192 vs 79088080
```

This issue commonly occurs in environments with:
- Limited disk space (e.g., Kaggle, Colab)
- File system issues or corruption
- Temporary I/O problems

## Solution

Implemented a robust `safe_checkpoint_save()` function that handles checkpoint saving with:

### 1. **Automatic Cleanup**
- Keeps only the last 3 checkpoint files (e.g., epoch 48, 49, 50)
- Automatically removes older checkpoints to free disk space
- Preserves `best_model.tar` (never deleted)
- Prevents disk space exhaustion

### 2. **Atomic File Writes**
- Writes to a temporary file first (`.tar.tmp` extension)
- Renames to final filename only after successful write
- Prevents corrupted checkpoint files
- Ensures data integrity

### 3. **Retry Logic**
- Up to 3 retry attempts for transient errors
- 1-second delay between retries
- Allows recovery from temporary I/O issues

### 4. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Training continues even if checkpoint save fails
- Clear error messages for debugging
- No crash or data loss

## Usage

The changes are transparent - no code changes needed in your training scripts. The `safe_checkpoint_save()` function is used automatically in place of `torch.save()`.

## Benefits

- ✅ Training won't crash due to disk space issues
- ✅ Automatic space management
- ✅ Protection against file corruption
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Continues training even when saves fail

## Testing

Run the included test to verify the functionality:

```bash
python3 test_checkpoint_error_handling.py
```

Expected output:
```
All tests PASSED! ✓✓✓
```

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic Code)
```python
torch.save({'epoch': epoch, 'state': model.state_dict()}, outfile)
```

### After (Robust Code)
```python
safe_checkpoint_save({'epoch': epoch, 'state': model.state_dict()}, outfile)
```

The `safe_checkpoint_save()` function:
1. Checks and cleans up old checkpoints if needed
2. Creates a temporary file in the same directory
3. Saves the checkpoint to the temporary file
4. Atomically renames the temporary file to the target filename
5. Retries on failure (up to 3 times)
6. Reports success or failure clearly

## Configuration

The function can be configured with optional parameters:

```python
safe_checkpoint_save(checkpoint_dict, filepath, max_retries=3)
```

- `checkpoint_dict`: Dictionary containing model state
- `filepath`: Target path for the checkpoint file
- `max_retries`: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
