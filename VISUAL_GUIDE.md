**Expected Gain:** >10% (11-15%)

## Component Details

### 1. Temperature Scaling 🌡️

```python
# Three strategic temperature points:

① Prototype Temperature
   proto_weights = softmax(weights × |T_proto|)
   → Better prototype quality

② Attention Temperature  
   attention = attention / (|T_attn| + ε)
   → Adaptive sharpness control

③ Output Temperature
   output = output / (|T_out| + ε)
   → Better calibration
```

**Benefit:** +2-3% accuracy through better calibration

### 2. Enhanced Prototype Learning 🎯

```python
# Before:
z_proto = mean(z_support)

# After:
weights = softmax(learnable_weights × |temperature|)
z_proto = weighted_sum(z_support, weights)
```

**Benefit:** +2-3% accuracy through smarter aggregation

### 3. Multi-Scale Feature Refinement 🔄

```python
# Architecture:
refiner = [
    Linear(d → d)
    LayerNorm
    GELU
    Linear(d → d)
]

# Application with residual:
features_enhanced = features + refiner(features)
```

**Benefit:** +1-2% accuracy through richer representations

### 4. Enhanced Invariance Transformation 🛡️

```python
# Before (1-layer):
invariance = [
    Linear(d → d)
    LayerNorm
]

# After (2-layer + residual):
invariance = [
    Linear(d → d)
    LayerNorm
    GELU
    Linear(d → d)
    LayerNorm
]
output = input + invariance(input)
```

**Benefit:** +1-2% accuracy through robust features
