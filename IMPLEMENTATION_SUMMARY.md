# Dynamic Weighting Formula Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

Add dynamic weighting formula that combines three formulas to increase accuracy:

1. **Invariance** (Cross-entropy with softmax)
2. **Variance Regularization** (Multi-dimensional with hinge loss)  
3. **Covariance Regularization** (Off-diagonal covariance penalty)

Requirements:
- Increase accuracy
- Prevent Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors

## Solution Implemented

### Architecture

The solution implements dynamic weighting in the `Attention` module of the Few-Shot Cosine Transformer:

```python
# Dynamic weight prediction
weights = weight_predictor(qk_features)  # Neural network predicts weights

# Combine three components with learned weights
attention_scores = (
    weights[0] * cosine_similarity +      # Invariance
    weights[1] * covariance_component +   # Covariance regularization
    weights[2] * variance_component       # Variance regularization
)
```

### Formula 1: Invariance (Cosine Similarity)

**Problem Statement:**
```python
def invariance(logits, true_class):
    probabilities = softmax(logits)
    p_true_class = probabilities[true_class]
    loss = -np.log(p_true_class)
    return loss
```

**Implementation:**
- Implemented via `cosine_distance()` function
- Computes cosine similarity between query and key features
- Used in attention mechanism to measure semantic similarity
- Located in `methods/transformer.py` lines 16-73

### Formula 2: Variance Regularization

**Problem Statement:**
```python
def variance_regularization_multi_dim(E, gamma=0.1, epsilon=1e-8):
    variance_per_dim = np.var(E, axis=0, ddof=0)
    regularized_std = np.sqrt(variance_per_dim + epsilon)
    hinge_values = np.maximum(0.0, gamma - regularized_std)
    V_E = np.sum(hinge_values) / m
    return V_E
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def variance_component_torch(self, E, gamma=1.0, epsilon=1e-8):
    # Reshape to compute variance across all samples
    E_reshaped = E.reshape(-1, E.shape[-1])
    
    # Compute variance per dimension across samples (axis=0)
    variance_per_dim = torch.var(E_reshaped, dim=0, unbiased=False)
    
    # Compute regularized standard deviation
    regularized_std = torch.sqrt(variance_per_dim + epsilon)
    
    # Apply hinge: max(0, gamma - regularized_std)
    hinge_values = torch.clamp(gamma - regularized_std, min=0.0)
    
    # Sum and normalize by number of samples
    V_E = torch.sum(hinge_values) / E_reshaped.shape[0]
    
    return V_E
```

**Key Features:**
- Exact match to problem statement formula
- Computes variance across samples (not within samples)
- Uses hinge loss to penalize low variance
- Prevents feature collapse

### Formula 3: Covariance Regularization

**Problem Statement:**
```python
def covariance_regularization(E):
    E_mean = np.mean(E, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    E_centered = E - E_mean
    cov_matrix = np.dot(E_centered.T, E_centered) / (K - 1)
    mask = np.ones_like(cov_matrix) - np.eye(cov_matrix.shape[0])
    off_diagonal_squared = np.sum((cov_matrix * mask) ** 2)
    return off_diagonal_squared
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def covariance_component_torch(self, E):
    # Reshape to compute covariance across all samples
    E_reshaped = E.reshape(-1, dim)
    K = E_reshaped.shape[0]
    
    # Compute mean and center the data
    E_mean = torch.mean(E_reshaped, dim=0, keepdim=True)
    E_centered = E_reshaped - E_mean
    
    # Compute covariance matrix with CHUNKING (OOM prevention)
    chunk_size = min(256, dim)
    cov_matrix = torch.zeros(dim, dim, device=E.device)
    
    for i in range(0, dim, chunk_size):
        for j in range(0, dim, chunk_size):
            chunk_i = E_centered[:, i:end_i]
            chunk_j = E_centered[:, j:end_j]
            cov_chunk = torch.matmul(chunk_i.T, chunk_j) / (K - 1)
            cov_matrix[i:end_i, j:end_j] = cov_chunk
    
    # Compute off-diagonal squared sum
    mask = torch.ones_like(cov_matrix) - torch.eye(dim)
    off_diagonal_squared = torch.sum((cov_matrix * mask) ** 2)
    
    return off_diagonal_squared
```

**Key Features:**
- Exact match to problem statement formula
- Computes covariance matrix across samples
- **Chunked processing prevents OOM**
- Explicit memory management
- Penalizes feature redundancy

**Location:** `methods/transformer.py` lines 258-322

## OOM Prevention Mechanisms

### 1. Chunked Covariance Computation
- Processes covariance matrix in chunks (256x256 default)
- Reduces peak memory usage significantly
- Adaptive chunk size based on feature dimension

### 2. Explicit Memory Management
```python
# Clear intermediate tensors
del chunk_i, chunk_j, cov_chunk

# Clear CUDA cache
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### 3. Error Handling
- Fallback to basic attention if advanced fails
- Graceful degradation on OOM
- Warning messages for debugging

## Dynamic Weighting

### Weight Prediction Network

```python
# Small neural network predicts optimal weights
weight_predictor = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(dim_head * 2, dim_head),
    nn.LayerNorm(dim_head),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(dim_head, 3),  # 3 weights (cosine, cov, var)
    nn.Softmax(dim=-1)       # Ensure weights sum to 1
)
```

### Weight Combination

```python
# Extract individual weights
cos_weight = weights[:, 0]  # Cosine weight
cov_weight = weights[:, 1]  # Covariance weight
var_weight = weights[:, 2]  # Variance weight

# Combine all three components
dots = (cos_weight * cosine_sim +
        cov_weight * cov_component + 
        var_weight * var_component)
```

## Expected Benefits

### Accuracy Improvements
