# Dataset Specification: DatasetIndo (Atopic Dermatitis Detection)

## 1. Overview
**DatasetIndo** (originally "Dermatitis Atopic Detection") is a specialized medical dataset sourced from Roboflow. It focuses on the detection and classification of **Atopic Dermatitis** (Eczema) lesions. This dataset serves as a **Local/Regional Contribution** to the thesis, demonstrating the model's applicability to specific dermatological conditions relevant to the Indonesian context or specific medical studies.

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Roboflow (User Contributed) |
| **Total Images** | 3,673 |
| **Original Resolution** | Various (Resized to $224 \times 224$) |
| **Target Resolution** | $84 \times 84$ (for FSL Model) |
| **Format** | Clip-format annotations (Object Detection converted to Classification) |

### 2.1. Data Composition
The dataset contains images of skin lesions categorized by severity or type (based on the specific split configuration in `base.json`, `val.json`, `novel.json`).
-   **Base (Train)**: Common lesion presentations.
-   **Val**: Validation set for hyperparameter tuning.
-   **Novel (Test)**: Rare or unseen lesion types/severities.

## 3. Role in Thesis
This dataset acts as a **Stress Test** for the model's adaptability to:
1.  **Noisy Data**: Unlike curated academic datasets (HAM10000), Roboflow datasets often contain variable lighting, blur, and inconsistent framing.
2.  **Fine-Grained Medical Classification**: Distinguishing between different grades or types of dermatitis requires learning texture-based features (redness, scaling, crusting).
3.  **Domain Adaptation**: Transferring knowledge from generic object recognition (miniImageNet) to specific skin pathology.

## 4. Preprocessing and Augmentation
The dataset comes with pre-applied augmentations from Roboflow, which we further process:
1.  **Roboflow Preprocessing**:
    -   Auto-orientation.
    -   Resize to $224 \times 224$ (Stretch).
2.  **Thesis Preprocessing**:
    -   Downsample to $84 \times 84$ to match the backbone input.
    -   Normalization (ImageNet stats).
3.  **Roboflow Augmentations** (Already present in images):
    -   Horizontal/Vertical Flip (50%).
    -   Rotation (90, 180, 270).

## 5. Experimental Protocol
We utilize the standard JSON split files (`base.json`, `val.json`, `novel.json`) to define the episodic tasks.
-   **Metric**: 5-Way 5-Shot Accuracy.
-   **Regularization**: We expect the **Episode-Adaptive Lambda** to predict high $\lambda_{cov}$ (Covariance Loss) to force the model to learn diverse textural features rather than relying on simple color histograms (redness).
